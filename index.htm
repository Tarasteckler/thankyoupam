<p>Thank you Pamela!! We really appreciate you taking the time to share your wisdom with our class. We all learned a lot about ways we can apply what we learn in this class
to our futures in the real world beyond high school. Your story is very inspiring and we loved hearing it! </p>
<p>Sincerely, Mr. Albinson's IB Computer Science</p>
